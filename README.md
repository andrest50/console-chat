# Console Chat
This a program for experimenting with client-server interaction using a chatroom in which users connect to a port and a server dispatches messages to each user in the chatroom. There is also some experimentation with private messaging between users, sending file contents, and having user commands.

# Usage
./server [port] (run the server) <br />
./client [port] (connect to the server-hosted chatroom)

# Example
Server hosting the chatroom: <br />

Client connecting and using the chatroom: <br />
