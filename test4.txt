What is this thing we are talking about? I don't quite know, other than that which we know already. It is by a commodius occasion that we are brought together on this fine evening. A cup in our hands and a joy that fills our faces and lights up the room. We are on the pinnicle of today, and the coming of tomorrow. Thank you all for having come tonight to spend your holidays with us. I am glad to have you all hear and hope that you have, and will continue, to enjoy your time here. To another great season to be jolly.What is this thing we are talking about? I don't quite know, other than that which we know already.
